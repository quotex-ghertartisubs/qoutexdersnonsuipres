## Is Quotex Banned in India?

in the future.

## What are the Risks of Trading on Quotex?

    probability of losing money when trading them.
-   Quotex has been accused of fraud and scamming traders.

## Is Quotex a Good Choice for Indian Traders?

Whether or not Quotex is a good choice for Indian traders depends on the
individual trader\'s risk tolerance and investment goals. If a trader is
comfortable with the risks involved, then Quotex may be a good option
for them. However, traders who are looking for a more regulated and
secure platform should look elsewhere.

including:

-   Zerodha

platform.
